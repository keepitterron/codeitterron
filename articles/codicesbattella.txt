Tasty test:

    :::ruby
    # it's 4 spaces indentation, don't forget that
    def test
      puts "test !" if super(nil)
    end

Some more?

    :::php
    echo "Hello World";
    
    MyClass::staticMethod();
    
    class A {
        private $a;
        
        public function f() {
            $this->a = "123";
        }
    }
    
    $a = new A();
    $a->f();

So what ?
